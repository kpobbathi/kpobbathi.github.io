            <h1>Science Fairs</h1>
            <p>I have participated in science fairs such as in 3rd grade and 5th grade. A science fair is an event hosted by a school that offers students the opportunity to experience the practices of science an engineering for themselves.
                The basic idea is that a science fair is a contest that involves science. Different people or teams compete to see whose project is better and to expand their knowledge in science.

            <p id="sci-writing">I was on a trip in Costa Rica, when my mom told me that I was invited to be in the Alta Vista's first ever science fair. I was pretty excited.
                My mom told me that I had to fill in a form about my science intrests first, so they could decide what kind of mentor I would get. I filled in physics, coding, robotics, and AI.
                I spent some time thinking about what my project should be. I had a Mindstorms lego robotics kit, so I was going to use that. I first thought about some robot that could navigate a course and obstacles.
                Then, I decided that I was going to make a robot that automatically aim at a target, as long as the robot is in range.</p>
